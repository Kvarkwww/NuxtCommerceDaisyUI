# About Us

At Rent-a-Games, we feel that a well-balanced life includes relaxation, fun and lots of play. So we're here to help you relax, unplug, and engage via board games, jigsaw puzzles and roleplaying games.

Because we love board games and are avid gamers ourselves, we know our products and stand behind our selections. We're patient and adept at teaching games. Hence our motto "We'll teach you how to play!"

From our earliest days as a couple, we dreamed of having a book and game store. We started Here Be Books & Games in 2005 with the desire to help you find books and games you love, so you can relax and unwind with a good book or unplug and engage with friends and family over a board game. 

Most of the books are gone now and jigsaw puzzles have been added to the mix, but the dream remains the same: helping you take a break, laugh and have a good time. Old-fashioned fun like board games and jigsaw puzzles have never gone out of style. They've become more mainstream than ever. Maybe that's because board games offer so many possibilities for enjoyment: they can be relaxing, engaging, hilarious or brain-burning.

We're here to help you find the right games for you and the people you game with so you can have fun. We'll even teach you how to play!
